# Inspecting the zshrc
$EDITOR ~/.zshrc
```
- `oh-my-bash`

```bash
# Installation  
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash/master/tools/install.sh)"
# Inspecting the zshrc
$EDITOR ~/.bashrc

# Modify the shell variable that controls the theme
#   OSH_THEME="random"

# Bring old stuff we'll need in the future
$EDITOR ~/.bashrc.omb-*
#   for i in $(ls -A $HOME/.bashrc.d/); do source $HOME/.bashrc.d/$i; done
```

- `oh-my-fish`

```bash
# Installation  
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/master/bin/install | fish
# Inspecting the zshrc

# Edit the $PROFILE file
& $env:EDITOR $PROFILE

# Paste the following contents into the $PROFILE file
#   Invoke-Expression (&starship init powershell)
```

- Install latest version of `PSReadLine` and enabling one nice feature

```ps1
Install-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Force
Install-Module -Name PSReadLine -Force

# Paste the following contents into the $PROFILE file
#   Set-PSReadLineOption -EditMode Emacs `
#       -PredictionSource History `
#       -PredictionViewStyle ListView
```

### Playing with the shells

- Install `spring-boot-cli` using `SDKMAN` in `bash`

```bash

```bash
echo ". \$SDKMAN_CANDIDATES_DIR/springboot/current/shell-completion/bash/spring" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

```bash
spring init -d web .
```

- Add a new REST Controller

    @RestController
    public static class HelloWorldController {
        @GetMapping("/hello")
        public String sayHello() {
            return "Hello World!!";
        }
    }
```

```
